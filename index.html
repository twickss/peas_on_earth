            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa fa-leaf"></i> Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project maps Seattle's P-Patch community gardens alongside the city's light rail network 
                    to help residents more easily locate accessible, local, and nutritious food options. 
                    In a city where transit access and healthy food availability vary widely by neighborhood,
                    this tool aims to bridge the gap by visualizing how close community members are 
                    to fresh produce grown in their own communities.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Card 2: Data Integration -->
            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa fa-map"></i> Data Integration</h2>
                <p>
                    At its core, the project integrates publicly available geospatial datasets, 
                    specifically P-Patch garden locations and Sound Transit light rail station data. 
                    By cleaning and mapping these datasets together, this tool highlights areas where transit 
                    accessibility and local food sources intersect, as well as areas where access is limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map is designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually clear, enabling users to quickly 
                    understand what's nearby, how to get there, and what opportunities exist to participate in 
                    Seattle's urban agriculture network.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Card 3: Food Equity -->
            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa fa-handshake-o"></i> Food Equity & Community Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond producing a useful interactive map, the project also explores broader questions about 
                    food equity, transit connectivity, and the role of community gardens in supporting sustainable, 
                    community-driven food systems. Many Seattle residents, especially those in transit-dependent 
                    or under-resourced neighborhoods, face structural barriers to reaching affordable, healthy food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By making this spatial information easy to explore, the project supports residents, planners, 
                    and community advocates in identifying gaps, proposing interventions, and celebrating the areas 
                    where local food access is already thriving.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Card 4: Purpose -->
            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, this project emphasizes that healthy, culturally diverse, and locally grown food 
                    should be within reach for everyone. By combining open data with thoughtful design, 
                    it aims to empower individuals, strengthen community connections, 
                    and contribute to a more equitable and sustainable Seattle.
                </p>
