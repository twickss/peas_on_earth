    <strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">What is a P Patch and why do they matter to Seattle?</strong>
    <br><br>
    This project maps Seattle’s P-Patch community gardens alongside the city’s light rail network to help residents more easily locate 
    accessible, local, and nutritious food options. In a city where transit access and healthy food availability vary widely by neighborhood,
    this tool aims to bridge the gap by visualizing how close community members are to fresh produce grown in their own communities.

    <br><br>

     At its core, the project integrates publicly available geospatial datasets, specifically P-Patch garden locations and Sound Transit light 
     rail station data. By cleaning and mapping these datasets together, this tool highlights areas where transit accessibility and local food 
     sources intersect, as well as areas where access is limited. The map is designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually clear, enabling users 
     to quickly understand what’s nearby, how to get there, and what opportunities exist to participate in Seattle’s urban agriculture network. 
     Beyond producing a useful interactive map, the project also explores broader questions about food equity, transit connectivity, and the role 
     of community gardens in supporting sustainable, community-driven food systems. Many Seattle residents, especially those in transit-dependent 
     or under-resourced neighborhoods, face structural barriers to reaching affordable, healthy food. By making this spatial information easy to 
     explore, the project supports residents, planners, and community advocates in identifying gaps, proposing interventions, and celebrating the 
     areas where local food access is already thriving.

    <br><br>

    Ultimately, this project emphasizes that healthy, culturally diverse, and locally grown food should be within reach for everyone. By 
    combining open data with thoughtful design, it aims to empower individuals, strengthen community connections, and contribute to a more 
    equitable and sustainable Seattle.
