# Peas on Earth 

## Description 
This project maps Seattle's P-Patch community gardens alongside the city's light rail network to help residents more easily locate accessible, local, and nutritious food options. In a city where transit access and healthy food availability vary widely by neighborhood, this tool aims to bridge the gap by visualizing how close community members are to fresh produce grown in their own communities.

## Project Goal
Beyond producing a useful interactive map, the project also explores broader questions about food equity, transit connectivity, and the role of community gardens in supporting sustainable, community-driven food systems. Many Seattle residents, especially those in transit-dependent or under-resourced neighborhoods, face structural barriers to reaching affordable, healthy food.

By making this spatial information easy to explore, the project supports residents, planners, and community advocates in identifying gaps, proposing interventions, and celebrating the areas where local food access is already thriving.

## Main Functions
When users first open the site, they land on a main page featuring a navigation bar that directs them to all project sections, including Light Rail, P-Patches, Meet the Team, Acknowledgements, and Games.

On the light rail map it shows stations in blue points and P-Patches appear as carrot icons. Usera can see all the P-Patches and draws a route to it based on their lightrail station. Users can also click on any P-Patch to view a pop-up displaying its name and address.

When users zoom in slightly the map switches to a 2D view showing more detailed information about the surrounding areas. And when users zoom in even more while holding CTRL it activates a 3D perspectives.

When users open the P-Patches map, the timeline slider displays all gardens established between 1970 and 2025 (with the earliest P-Patch in our dataset in 1973).
